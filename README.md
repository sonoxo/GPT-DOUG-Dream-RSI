## Overview

**Progress in recursive self-improvement hinges on effective exploration.** As self-improvement
targets get harder, discovery stretches over thousands of proposal–evaluation cycles, and poor
exploration wastes substantial computation on ineffective search directions. Managing and improving
the exploration strategy is the bottleneck, and current systems face a dilemma: fixed strategies
cannot adapt as search spaces scale, while optimizing the policy online means navigating a vast
meta-search space under delayed and expensive feedback — assessing one exploration policy requires
observing how it shapes an entire discovery process.

**Our key insight is that accumulated discovery history can serve as a replay simulator over the
realized search space.** A completed discovery process already records a structured tree of past
exploration decisions and their realized code-execution outcomes. An alternative policy can traverse
that tree differently: different subsets of recorded branches, in different orders, with different
parallel groupings and stopping decisions. Because all outcomes are already saved, evaluating it
requires only reading past records — no rerunning of the discovery agent or the evaluator. By analogy
with model-based RL and world models, the history becomes a world the agent can *dream* in.

**Dream-RSI closes a self-improvement loop at the exploration layer.** A lightweight orchestration
layer makes exploration explicit and programmable — branching, parallel exploration, stopping —
while leaving the underlying coding agent unchanged. ❶ the current policy drives online discovery
and logs its traces; ❷ the recorded trees are converted into a reusable simulator pool; ❸ candidate
policies are evaluated and refined by dreaming over that pool, which returns immediate, low-cost
off-policy feedback. The improved policy is redeployed online, continuously expanding the pool.

## Highlights

- **History as replay simulator.** We conceptualize completed discovery histories as replay
  simulators, which makes delayed exploration feedback reusable for efficient meta-exploration
  policy evaluation.
- **Meta-layer RSI loop.** Dream-RSI continuously collects discovery histories through online
  exploration, constructs replay simulators from them to refine meta-exploration strategies via
  dreaming, and redeploys the upgraded policy online.
- **Empirical validation.** Across algorithm engineering, mathematical optimization and GPU kernel
  engineering, Dream-RSI improves both discovery effectiveness and efficiency in several settings.
